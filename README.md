We want to determine which variables effect the equity loan and whether a person is a good or bad credit risk. The possible determinants of BAD are LOAN, MORTDUE, VALUE, REASON, JOB, YOJ, DEROG, DELINQ, CLAGE, NINQ, and DEBTINC. The Y (response variable) is Bad, which is a categorical variable.

For this course, we utilized JMP Pro 15 developed by SAS. Each student analysed and created their own models. Due to my curiousity, I decided to run 26 different models to see which model(s) best predicted the testing data.
